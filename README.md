# 🎬 Cine-Suggest: Movie Recommendation System

A Flask-based web application that provides movie recommendations using machine learning algorithms.  
The system uses the TMDB dataset to suggest similar movies based on user input.

---
## 📊 Dataset Setup

This project uses the TMDB 5000 Movies and Credits datasets for generating movie recommendations.

Since the files are large, they are stored separately under the **Releases** section of this repository.

You can download them directly using the links below:

- [tmdb_5000_movies.csv](https://github.com/kavinhr/Cine-Suggest/releases/download/v1.0/tmdb_5000_movies.csv)
- [tmdb_5000_credits.csv](https://github.com/kavinhr/Cine-Suggest/releases/download/v1.0/tmdb_5000_credits.csv)

### 🧱 Setup Instructions

1. Download both CSV files from the links above.  
2. Place them in the **root directory** of the project (same folder as `app.py`).  
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
